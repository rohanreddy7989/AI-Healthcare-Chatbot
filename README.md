**AI Healthcare Chatbot**

AI Healthcare Chatbot is an intelligent, AI-powered chatbot designed to provide personalized health recommendations, symptom assessment, and triage guidance. This project demonstrates the application of data analysis, machine learning, and AI techniques to deliver actionable health insights.

Developed during my **Data Science Internship at upGrad Campus**, this project combines data science, **ML modeling**, and interactive web deployment to provide a user-friendly healthcare assistant.

**Features:**

**->** Symptom Assessment & Triage:

**->** Predicts potential health conditions based on user-reported symptoms using Decision Tree and Random Forest models.

**->** Performs feature analysis to determine the most significant symptoms for predictions.

**Personalized Health Recommendations:**

**->** Computes BMI and tracks health metrics.

**->** Provides diet, exercise, and lifestyle suggestions based on user data.

**Data Analysis & Visualization:**

**->** Analyses user input and symptom trends using Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn.

**->** Generates insights from collected health data, enabling better prediction and recommendation.

**Information Retrieval:**

**->** Integrates with Wikipedia API to fetch detailed explanations about diseases, treatments, and medical terms.

**Wearable Device Compatibility:**

**->** Accepts data from wearable devices for real-time health monitoring and recommendation.

**Multi-platform Support:** 

**->** Optimized for both web and mobile interfaces.

**Deployment & Testing:**

**->** Deployed via Render API for public access.

**->** Ensured robust model performance with thorough testing and validation.

**Technologies & Tools:**

**Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript (frontend)

**Machine Learning & AI:** scikit-learn (Decision Tree, Random Forest), pandas, NumPy

**Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

**APIs:** Wikipedia API

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Deployment:** Render API

**Notebook & Development:** Jupyter Notebook for ML modeling, data preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

**Data Science & ML Workflow**

**Data Collection & Cleaning**

**->** Gathered healthcare datasets for symptom-to-disease mapping.

**->** Cleaned and preprocessed data to ensure accurate model input.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**->** Visualized symptom frequency, correlation between symptoms and diseases, and patient demographics.

**Model Development**

**->** Trained Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers for symptom-based disease prediction.

**->** Conducted hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

**Evaluation & Validation**

**->** Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**->** Selected the best-performing model for deployment.

**Integration & Deployment**

**->** Integrated the ML model into the chatbot interface.

**->** Connected the system with Wikipedia API for informative responses.

**->** Deployed the chatbot online for public access.
